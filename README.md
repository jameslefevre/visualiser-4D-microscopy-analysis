# visualiser-4D-microscopy-analysis

This Processing 3 sketch provides a 3/4D visualiser for microscopy data designed to view and compare original imaging, one or more semantic segmentations, and object and track representations (based on the segmentations or otherwise). There is a particular emphasis on efficiently comparing alternative forms and derivatives of the data by easily switching between them. The specific purpose is to aid in training data selections and otherwise support and display the outputs of the analysis pipeline provided here:

Not all supported data types need to be present, and the tool is easily adapted to other data sources.
See manual (visualiser_manual.md) for details of data preparation and use of the visualiser app.
